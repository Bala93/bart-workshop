# BART Workshop Materials

This repository contains information and demos for the [Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART)](http://mrirecon.github.io/bart).
Part of this material will be presented at the [2016 ISMRM Workshop on Data Sampling & Image Reconstruction](http://www.ismrm.org/workshops/Data16/).

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to host and share demos and workshop materials for BART. From the [website](http://mrirecon.github.io/bart):

> The Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) is a free and open-source image-reconstruction framework
> for Computational Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It consists of a programming library and a toolbox of command-line
> programs. The library provides common operations on multi-dimensional arrays, Fourier and wavelet transforms,
> as well as generic implementations of iterative optimization algorithms. The command-line tools provide direct
> access to basic operations on multi-dimensional arrays as well as efficient implementations of many calibration
> and reconstruction algorithms for parallel imaging and compressed sensing.

## Getting Started
The most up-to-date information can be found at the official BART website: http://mrirecon.github.io/bart.

The workshop material was tested with [BART version 0.3.00](https://github.com/mrirecon/bart/releases/tag/v0.3.00)

### Download
The source code is available at [https://github.com/mrirecon/bart/archive/v0.3.00.tar.gz](https://github.com/mrirecon/bart/archive/v0.3.00.tar.gz).
Untar and navigate to the bart directory:
```bash
wget https://github.com/mrirecon/bart/archive/v0.3.00.tar.gz
