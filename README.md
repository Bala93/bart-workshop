```
Congratulations on being selected to present your software in Sedona on Tuesday night, Session 8.  The session will
include a short 3-minute pitch from each of you about your software - which Michael Hansen, the organizer, may tell you
more about - followed by a ~1.5 hour demo session.  For the demo session, each of you will have a table to set your
laptop (you must bring your laptop!!) and a monitor (our lab in Phoenix will bring 6 up with us), so that people can
stand behind you to watch or try out themselves.  If a mouse is necessary, I would ask that you bring the mouse as well
- we will provide only power and a monitor.

For the monitors - I need to know what connection you need.  If you have options, I’ll tell you we have a lot of Apple
Thunderbolt displays here - but if you need a different connector (DVI, HDMI, etc.), please let me know ASAP so I can
plan to bring the right monitors.

If you need something else - or if you feel that you don’t want to do a software session - please let me know.  I look
forward to seeing you all here next month!!!

Take care,
Jim
