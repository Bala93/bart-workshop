This demo uses BART with Matlab to perform a Wave-CAIPI reconstruction followed by a retrospective Wave-CS
reconstruction. The Wave-CS recon uses the BART C API to extend the forward model in a parallel imaging and
compressed sensing reconstruction.

Follow the instructions in the [`data`](data) directory to download the data. See example output in the [`html`](html)
directory, and run the Matlab demo [`demo_wave_cs.m`](demo_wave_cs.m).
